BUT

~~I only want to be able to see the VIP link when the customer is logged in~~

~~I only want to see the Sign Up link when a customer isn't signed in~~

Note: for this exercise, indicate whether a customer is signed in manually in your controller. Hint: you can use a global variable, which would be in your Class, and formatted like this $user_logged_in = true to change the value in all of your methods at once: @user = $user_logged_in
